# BU_EC519_Voice_Signal_Processing
## Class Description
Speech (naturally spoken) is the main mode of communication between humans. Speech technology aims at providing the means for speech-controlled man-machine interaction. The goal of this course is to provide the basic concepts and theories of speech production, speech perception, and speech signal processing. The course is organized in a manner that builds a strong foundation of basics, followed by a range of signal processing methods for representing and processing the speech signal.

## Project1
- Start, Endpoint, V-UNV Detection 

  Based on log energy and zero crossing rate

- Effect of background noise

  Freeze parameters from previous section

  Additive white Gaussian noise, with 20,10 and 0 dB SNR
  
- Pitch Estimator - choose one

  Parallel time domian processor described in class

  Autocorrelation (full band, 900 Hz filtered)

  Harmonic spectrum

### Project2
- LP Synthesis with a Binary source

  The goal of this project is to build an LPC Vocoder based on the model of speech production.
  
### Project3
- Quantization-binary source

  LP parameters, Pitch, Gain
  
  chose a parameter set, best for quantization
  
  3 bit rates: 2400 bps, 3600 bps, 4800 bps
  
  since on a bit-rate budget
